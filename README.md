  The program was designed to help the store management look up items on the grocery list and see how many items were sold for the day. The program had to read data from an input file and extract all items with the respective quantity.
  I did well-reading data from the file, counting the occurrence of items, and writing that data into a new file while displaying the respective histogram of the data.
  I would enhance the program to print a color-coded histogram and have the items align left while the quantity data aligns right.
  I found it challenging developing code to read and write in python and C++. Trying to make sure the two languages were able to communicate was tough but doable. 
  Research skills gained from this project will serve me well as I seek to develop more code that makes our everyday interactions with data simple.
  I utilized comments to help future programmers to understand my intention with the code. I utilized functions to handle the different aspects of the code which makes it easy to make improvements to the code.
